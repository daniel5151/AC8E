# AC8E - Another CHIP-8 Emulator
### A CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust for fun and learning

I've never used Rust before, so this project is my way of trying to get a feel
for the language.

If this code isn't :100: *idiomatic* Rust, cut me some slack :smile:

### External Dependencies:

Make sure `ncurses` is installed. If you're on Linux / OSX, this should be
a relatively straightforward process. If you're on Windows, glhf.
